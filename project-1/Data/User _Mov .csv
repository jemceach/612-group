1,1,TheTopDawg,8,Better than expected!,"For a B-grade film, this was surprisingly better than I expected. The acting was great by all cast members, the directing was on point, the writing was actually pretty good - without many plot issues one would normally expect, the cinematography perfect, the pacing was great, especially for the 107 min length, and the editing not too bad except for the flashbacks. My only critique was the terrible score, especially towards the last act. Had the score been more professional and consistent through out, the suspense would have been stellar instead of adequate. Overall an impressive film. A well deserved 8/10 from me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even with David Tennant playing the big bad wolf, he stumbles too much to save Bad Samaritan from being, well, a bad movie.I really wanted to like Bad Samaritan, especially because Im a sucker for a good horror movie that can make your skin crawl.

Really, Bad Samaritan will likely be a film that comes and goes and never knows that it existed. However, I actually thought it was a pretty well made film. Granted, it starts to fall apart after the hour mark, but if youre just looking for a cheap thrill with some fun performances, creepy imagery, and good time at the theater, then look no further than Bad Samaritan.

The studio has consistently delivered smart, funny, brave films that both embrace and transcend their comic-book origins.

Upon first viewing, I hated him, but found his character intriguing. Similar to Emperor Palpatine in the Original and Prequel trilogies of Star Wars. The more times I rewatch it though, I start to understand Thanos point of view more and more. The blurred lines with his motivations make the movie more compelling.

It just keeps coming at you relentlessly. At the same time theres not enough real story and characterisation, not enough time to take in whats going on and definitely not enough warmth or comedy which is the hallmark of many Marvel films Ive seen before.

Okay, fair enough shes a slut but the fact that the main character was covering for that and that blonde friend got mad for revealing the truth. The build up of character is all a mess and where their priority lies is just all over the place.

132,6,nkbtw,10,An instant classic!,Bradley cooper and Lady Gaga collaboration on this remake of the classic A Star Is Born results in an outstanding movie and soundtrack that keeps you looking ofr more until the very end of the movie.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
133,6,Ed-Shullivan,4,A Star Is Bored,"I am more than just a bit surprised how many of the IMDB reviews just glow about this remake, of another remake, of another remake of yet still another remake. In case some people dont realize it, this film has been over cooked since the 1930s. Maybe women love Bradley Cooper so this is his vanity project in which he is credited as the writer, director, and star. Heck, Bradley Cooper even went as far as having a Sam Elliott voice over by copying Elliotts gravelly voice and Mr. Vanity Cooper even gives himself several minutes of solo face time singing as a past-his-prime-time weary weathered alcoholic singing star.Oh sure, Cooper pulled out as many pity points that he possibly could by including his loyal dog pining for our over the hill rock star. While Jack hides behind his closed garage door his dog rests in front of the door resting alone and waiting for his master Jack to come out from behind the closed garage door. Awwwwww shucks. Coopers screenplay denotes sappy sucker tears cal""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
134,6,charlesponchon,5,Overated,"Only went because the average rating on IMDb were very high and I usually found them very reliable.Unfortunately this time they were not a good indicator.Its a very average movie, boring at times, with a poor actress performance from Lady Gaga.I do not comprehend how it can be rated above a 6/10 to be honest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
135,6,martimusross,4,Unconvincing As A Love Story,"The very heart of this movie is the love story between the rising star Lady Gaga and the jaded drug ridden alcoholic that is Bradley Coopers falling star. On many levels the chemistry just wasnt there, Bradleys convincing method style was fully realised as a train wreck of a man but lacked any real character development, Lady Gagas acting was very on the surface and at some points you could practically see her counting her emotional responses on line and on cue.The emotional responses seemed to be confined between pathetic and hysterical that jarred with Bradleys more nuanced emotional palette. Clearly Gaga devotees will see no fault. The pacing of the movie was laborious at times with any tension evaporating entirely. Two aspects of the movie were worthy of note, firstly the realistic concerts and the documentary nature of the camera work, and lastly, on the whole, the music, it was great fun but not memorable as it was set within an unconvincing movie.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
136,6,mrsdoyle_2005,4,Surprised at high reviews,"I was looking forward to this due to the high ratings and that I like the lead actors. However felt it was a poor story, fairly predictable, slightly cringeworthy acting, I kept hoping it would improve but was disappointed",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
137,6,rquku,1,"Boring, predictive, repetitive...","Lady Gaga can sing, but i can not say therefore that was a good movie. I was waiting the whole time when the heck this movie would end. I do not recommend it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
138,6,Harrymiller1215,8,Awesome debut for Coopers direction and Gagas,"It will be nominated for several Oscars and win best original song"" for sure.Whether you love Gaga as a singer or not", lets just appreciate and enjoy this amazing work by a new actress, LadyGaga. Sam and Bradley are also brilliant in their character. A Star Is Born is not the typical genre of movie like Moonlight/Spotlight/Blackkklansman that will probably snatch Oscars for best picture, but I can promise it will still do well in the award seasons. To sum up," it will gain both commercial and critical success. Just enjoy it as a romantic/musical film!""",,,,,,,,,,,
139,6,themadmovieman,7,"Starts in exhilarating fashion, although lose","Its a story as old as time, and thats evident in the fact that Bradley Coopers A Star Is Born is the fourth yes, FOURTH remake of the movie classic. However, with clearly passionate directing and acting throughout, furthered by wonderful music and an efficient portrayal of the classic rags-to-riches story, this proves a thoroughly entertaining and memorable watch that absolutely flies by over the course of nearly two and a half hours.But before we get into all that, I have to start with the films opening half hour, which is exceptional. Despite its long running time, theres so much packed into the opening act, and its delivered with jaw-dropping passion and energy, to the point where I felt absolutely exhilarated by the film within such a short period of time.The passion with which Bradley Cooper is directing the movie is clear from the opening scene, and as we see our superstar musician form an unlikely and unexpected bond with a young local singer, the film begins to tell that age-ol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
140,6,athens-24109,10,Best movie of the year,"This movie really touched my heart, it really is the best movie of the year and everyone should see this masterpiece.

141,6,peter-nichta-564-860549,2,no stars were born during this movie,"Gaga is one of the best voices there is but the songs are as terrible as the laziest pop songwriters can go, so there goes the voice. first 30 minutes was a bit watchable, Cooper was being a overly deep, sympathetic drunk, gaga was..gaga? ..then the plot deploys and removes the watchableness..not worthy of paing money to watch, watched bad times at the el royale last friday because this was sold out and that was by far a more enjoyable movie",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
142,6,josh_henry80,1,A Star is bored,"It was well acted, directed, and the music was good. But the story is yawn. Not trying to rip anybody but I checked my watch a dozen times during this movie. Its also my opinion that the characters werent developed properly. Introduce us to the characters and let us see who they are prior to meeting each other.Sam Elliot & Andrew Dice Clay were standouts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

144,6,sissyneck23,2,Average,"Its watchable. Sorry but its just not as good as all the reviews I read before seeing it. Gaga cant act, shes pretty one dimensional throughout. Am I the only one that sees that?! Songs are ok but theyre very X Factor/Reality tv fodderStick to the Streisand film, much better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
145,6,bob-the-movie-man,4,Dullsville Arizona.,"This story has been filmed three times before in 1937 with Janet Gaynor and Fredric March; 1954 with Judy Garland and James Mason and 1976 with Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson. In all of these films the story has been the same an alcoholic and over-the-hill actor or with Kris Kristofferson, rock star finds a young talented ingenue to love and develop into a superstar.The modern day remake is a little different in that Jackson Maine, our older star now played by Bradley Cooper, is a stadium-filling mega-rock-star, recognised and idolised in every bar he goes into.... and he frequents a LOT of bars. Maine mixes the cocktail with drugs in this version meaning that as one star is ascending, his seems destined to be heading into a black hole.At its heart, this is a good story of having self-confidence in your own abilities, no matter how people around you try to put you down. Gagas Ally is one such person; a waitress who is constantly being told, especially by her blue-collar dad an",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
146,6,lorriejinx,1,A ONE STAR IS BORN !,"This film has little emotional feel to it. You would get more emotion from an episode of hollyoaks. Lady Gaga is pretty good in the lead role but Bradley Cooper is quite frankly a poor acrtor who has only made it because of his looks. He was just not a convincing alcoholic / drug addict. As for his direction, words fail me.The film just doesnt flow from the get go and the script is amateurish and patchy. Dont waste your money on this turkey.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
147,6,plargreg,1,over rated emotional garbage,"Is purposefully unintelligently heavy handed so as to seem as a plot is well developed when its not, just keeps going back and forth to keep you think you are feeling"" things when you are really not"," bad just very very bad""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
148,6,luke-solly,1,Cant understand how this film is getting such,"This movie is just plain bad. There must be some big payola going round this awards season. Badly written, average acting at best, all the characters are unrelatable and inlikeable. 2 hours of my life wasted. Gaga was edited out of any opportunity to really act and other actors carried her scenes on there back. Bradley Cooper just drank swore and mumbled for 2 hours. I really dont understand where all the good reviews and awards are coming from.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
149,6,viraltux,4,The best part of the movie is when I had to g,"Unfortunately we dont have a reliable way to tell the true ratings of a movie.If it wasnt for the ridiculously overblown ratings I wouldnt mind, perhaps I would have watched it anyway because I like Bradley Cooper, but being lured into watching this thing expecting a 8-9 star movie... not cool. This is a movie just for Lady Gaga hardcore fans, anybody else expect a every average product.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
