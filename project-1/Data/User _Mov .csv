1,1,TheTopDawgCritic,8,Better than expected!,"For a B-grade film, this was surprisingly better than I expected. The acting was great by all cast members, the directing was on point, the writing was actually pretty good - without many plot issues one would normally expect, the cinematography perfect, the pacing was great, especially for the 107 min length, and the editing not too bad except for the flashbacks. My only critique was the terrible score, especially towards the last act. Had the score been more professional and consistent through out, the suspense would have been stellar instead of adequate. Overall an impressive film. A well deserved 8/10 from me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are definitely some moments in the film that will make audiences jump and cringe. However, a lot of those scenes that make you cringe are the ones where David Tennants American accent starts to slip.

And besides David Tennant, theres really no big name here at all and there wasnt a single bit of marketing that I saw, so theres that. Really, Bad Samaritan will likely be a film that comes and goes and never knows that it existed. However, I actually thought it was a pretty well made film. Granted, it starts to fall apart after the hour mark, but if youre just looking for a cheap thrill with some fun performances, creepy imagery, and good time at the theater, then look no further than Bad Samaritan. The film has no place making some of the third act decisions it does however, it never fully jumps the proverbial shark, and its always entertaining. 7.3/10",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Upon first viewing, I hated him, but found his character intriguing. Similar to Emperor Palpatine in the Original and Prequel trilogies of Star Wars. The more times I rewatch it though, I start to understand Thanos point of view more and more. The blurred lines with his motivations make the movie more compelling.

The game of Truth or Dare? is no fun when the truth hurts and the dares maim. In fact, thats the biggest problem with Blumhouses Truth or Dare its not fun.

No total destruction of cities during some big fight which is totally unbelievable. You cause millions of dollars of damage to the city and nobody has trouble believing that. Really. It has a plot that is believable for this type movie. I personally thought it was as good or perhaps better than Get Out. Doing a brain transplant in the basement of your parents home by yourself?

However, Blumhouse have released the latest rock bottom horror film that is one to forget as it contained minimal and predictable jump scares, a poor range of acting throughout however some possible potential from lead character Lucy Hale.If youre thinking about watching this film, dont spend the money in the cinema because its just not worth it and will probably be shown on TV or be on Netflix or Amazon Prime within the next year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The family for which the movie gets its name is hardly relevant, with Dash and Violet having no impact on the plot and Dash failing to receive even an attempt at a subplot. Mr. Incredible fails in everything he attempts in both heroic and domestic pursuits, and Elastigirl saves a few lives before falling for an obvious trap and being controlled by the villain.As the story comes to its climax, all of the heroes including Frozone and both parents have been enslaved by the villain and its up to Violet, Dash, and Jack-Jack to save the day.

Not surprisingly, the movie emphasizes how poorly Mr incredible is at handling his new duties at home. The main message of this movie is that Elastigirl is just as good or better than Mr Incredible at superhero work, while Mr Incredible is vastly inferior at taking care of the kids and home life in general. So basically, he is just all around inferior to her. Or lets just say it out loud, Men are inferior to women. That is the real message of the film.

That being said, the film seems to be getting WAY overblown by people. The first act is really great and the chemistry between Gaga and Cooper is phenomenal but after that it sort of devolves into a melodrama. The character development of Coopers character is lacking. He is an alcoholic and we certainly see him drunk many times but I didnt see enough struggle to justify his character arc not was Coopers performance powerful enough to convey the devastating agony of addiction. The film then goes through a few cliches as we see Gagas character ascend to fame but again, we also dont see enough struggle from her character either.

Janet Gaynor had brought a form of overwhelming innocence, Judy Garland exploded in heartbreak in a Hollywood that doesnt exist anymore and she was, unquestionably, memorable. Barbara Streisand was tough with a strong sense of self even during her tribulations. Lady Gaga brings a little of each of them as well as something profoundly personal. Kudos to Bradley Cooper.

On many levels the chemistry just wasnt there, Bradleys convincing method style was fully realised as a train wreck of a man but lacked any real character development, Lady Gagas acting was very on the surface and at some points you could practically see her counting her emotional responses on line and on cue.The emotional responses seemed to be confined between pathetic and hysterical that jarred with Bradleys more nuanced emotional palette. Clearly Gaga devotees will see no fault. The pacing of the movie was laborious at times with any tension evaporating entirely.

What would you do, and would you go weak in the knees or be  overcome with disbelief that youre actually, finally, realizing your  dream?

This method can so easily fail, but Im very pleased with how well it works here.This story is nothing new as Shrek and Fiona are summoned to Far Far Away to meet Fionas parents who are the king and queen, and unsurprisingly Shrek and the king dont get along.

Love that reinvents itself, multiplies itself, opens itself up, and even devastates.I am sure the film has its critics who say it drips in buttery corn. But when you are able to retreat inward and let it take you over, it is impossible not to feel. It is a rare treat - a film that makes you feel. During the process I was sad and happy and relieved. I was turned on, turned off, dizzy and grounded.I was in love one time and it reminded me of that. The power of cinema can be that amazing, it can be that intense. The title of the movie is, perhaps, meant to confuse. Yet I believe it is designed to ask. Love Actually is ... what?Is it lust? Or a deep appreciation of the past?

The structure of the film seems, surprisingly, underfunded. I know, it is an animation. Still, it looks like they had plenty of opportunities to go big and instead were on lease. And were pinned down and staged to please with cheesy content and adorable animation; drool over, once again.

As they bring CGI and other animation tactics to the table, the stories that follow have a big job of trying to make a film that is entertaining to all ages without dipping down one end over the other. While there are many animated studios out there ready to give it a shot, not every studio finds a way to achieve those goals, becoming a cash grab instead of a quality adventure. This week, an early showing of the The Secret Life Of Pets 2 came to screen and I had my suspicions that this sequel might have been just that.

The movie focuses on three different sets of characters in three different plots, and two of them are entirely filler. It reaches the credits at around the 80 minute mark and Id say about 20 minutes of the runtime is the actual plot Snowball and the Circus Tiger. Worst of all, the main character Max gets the least amount of screentime and his subplot contributes almost nothing aside from hearing Harrison Ford voice an animal. The Cat subplot is just there for stupid gags and contributes nothing as well.It really felt like three different episodes or short films stitched together to make it feature length and you know what it wouldnt be so bad if it was at least entertaining to watch. Sadly, the jokes are not funny at all and the whole thing is bland and uninspiring. Honestly, for me it made the first Secret Life of Pets seem not too bad in comparison.

Hearing how much people loved Secret Life of Pets gave me a bit of hope that perhaps this movie would be Illuminations breakthrough. The one that would have the best animation, story, characters, emotions, etc.Unfortunately, Secret Life of Pets just ended up being another okay movie for me. Right when I saw the trailers, I was reminded of Toy Story with the plot. I feared that the plot would be predictable, and it definitely was. A few different things were thrown in, but as a whole, the story was pretty predictable. One of the different things that was thrown in had potential to be a really emotional scene.

Hopes were high as the trailer for Zootopia was inciting and that film did not disappoint. However, Secret Life of Pets turned out to be a fizzer. Excessively violent for a childrens film, not funny or clever and really rather odd. The characters are not developed which means that the audience doesnt particularly care what happens on their quest. The stand out of the film is the husky little white fluffball of a dog. I think this film is aimed at children, though the guy down the row from me was certainly laughing a lot while I was taking power naps. Not the same caliber as Despicable Me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two dogs named Max voiced by Louis C.K. and Duke voiced by Eric Stonestreet get separated from their owner when out for a walk. The film chronicles their journey back home.This is clearly aimed at kids but has plenty of humor that adults will enjoy. Im in my 50s and laughed long and loud at some of the antics. The script is good and moves quickly. I was never bored. With one exception the voices perfectly fit the characters. The one exception was Snowball. Hes a psychotic rabbit voiced by Kevin Hart. Hart can be funny but not here. He YELLS every word out at the audience. It gets annoying quick. The animation is greatvery fluid and pleasing to the eye. The backdrops of NYC are breath-taking. The only real debit is there are some glaring lapses in logic but it IS a kids film. Recommended.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I think the eventual happy ending that concludes the movie is suited to the kids and they will come out happy they saw it.The characters arent as compelling as Disney/Pixar characters but I think there were more jokes in this one than usual. I also dont think there were as much emotional obstacles for the characters to conquer in this one opposed to a Disney/Pixar movie. This movie was just fun almost all the way through.

The two opposing dogs must then work together however, before Katie gets back when they are lost in the big city.For an original story done by Illumination, it does creatively borrow off the concepts of both Toy Story as well as the 2008 film Bolt, yet it flows out well with the voice cast bringing these characters to life which include stand-up comic Louis C.K. voicing the leading dog Max, Jenny Slate Saturday Night Live, Zootopia as M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have to say the characters make the dumbest decision ever, also every time they try to run a minute later they run back into the same room and hide and have stupid conversations. That is basically the last hour of the movie. The only reason I gave this movie a 5 is Patrick Stewart. He was great in this movie and I wished they included more of him and had a better role for him. I was disappointed in how little screen time he had.

Green Room continues the vein of comically inept people in violent situations, but its too crowded and lacks the subversiveness that made Blue Ruin so riveting. More characters means more bloodshed, but it uses that a crutch to get easy thrills rather than spending time getting us invested. Nevertheless, on concept alone its destined for cult status, but lets hope Saulnier has a better idea up his sleeve next.

Somewhere near the beginning of the film is a scene that goes from zero to psycho in about 2 seconds flat. The beginning of 2004s Dawn of the Dead also had a wildly chaotic kick-off scene, but unlike that film, which was a great film to laugh through while chomping your popcorn, this film is no laughing matter. When theres no violence, theres fear and tension. When there is on-screen violence, there is absolute shock and horror. Scene after scene shows ordinary people placed in impossible situations from which they cannot escape. This time, of course, there now two implacable predators out there hunting them down the rage virus from the first film, and the military which is attempting to maintain control of any outbreak, but is willing to visit unspeakable horrors upon innocent people if they cannot keep that control.

After a short time, the house is attacked and most of the group killed by the zombie-like masses. The husband and wife are separated and he flees to water, barely escaping with his life.Here is my first of many complaints of this film. The separation of the couple is used as a cheap emotional ploy to discredit Carlyle. Standing across the room from his wife, whom he had desperately been pleading that she flee with him, he is outnumbered by rage-infected and weaponless. He makes the only choice he possibly can as a realistic character and takes the way out which is available to him.

And although the Rage virus in these two films does not produce an undead zombie, the infected nevertheless present a similarly formidable and threatening antagonist. If you havent seen either film, Boyles infected are far less like the traditional lumbering Romero zombies, and closer to the Zack Snyder zombies of 2004s Dawn of the Dead. Note that if you were able to get away with seeing 28 Days Later as a date movie, you may not pull it off with 28 Weeks.

I also disapproved of the director switch, fearing that yet another low-budget gem will be Americanised by Hollywood, made far too slick for its own good.So to say 28 Weeks Later was a pleasant surprise would be an understatement. Fresnadillo managed to maintain everything that was good in the original and add his own flair. The rage virus, the zombies and the gore are all still here.

Everyone lived in high rise apartment buildings. The buildings themselves could have been put on lock down, and everyone locked in their apartment.

There are definitely some moments in the film that will make audiences jump and cringe. However, a lot of those scenes that make you cringe are the ones where David Tennants American accent starts to slip. Im not sure why they decided to make his character American, possibly to make Robert Sheehans Irish accent stand out more, but its definitely not one of Tennants strong suits.

This was been one of the best thriller movie I have seen realizing how good the camera and background sounds was all set up in accordingly. Also plus points for the casts they really gave justice to their own role.

And besides David Tennant, theres really no big name here at all and there wasnt a single bit of marketing that I saw, so theres that. Really, Bad Samaritan will likely be a film that comes and goes and never knows that it existed. However, I actually thought it was a pretty well made film. Granted, it starts to fall apart after the hour mark, but if youre just looking for a cheap thrill with some fun performances, creepy imagery, and good time at the theater, then look no further than Bad Samaritan. The film has no place making some of the third act decisions it does however, it never fully jumps the proverbial shark, and its always entertaining. 7.3/10",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The studio has consistently delivered smart, funny, brave films that both embrace and transcend their comic-book origins. The 18 blockbuster movies produced since Iron Man first blasted off into the stratosphere in 2008 have not only reinvented superhero films as a genre - theyve helped to legitimise it. Indeed, Marvels two most recent films - Thor Ragnarok and Black Panther - have received the kind of accolades usually reserved for edgy arthouse flicks. And yet, its perfectly reasonable to be apprehensive about Avengers Infinity War. This is a blockbuster film thats been ten years in the making, its plot hinted at and scattered throughout 18 other movies.

Also delivering comedy when needed, but it was a relatively dark film. All of the actors delivered great performances and the characters continue to be fleshed out and be made human despite the fact that theyre superheroes. This is easily the best superhero movie ever made. Thanos is one of the best villains of the MCU, as well as one of the best of Cinematic history in general. Upon first viewing, I hated him, but found his character intriguing. Similar to Emperor Palpatine in the Original and Prequel trilogies of Star Wars. The more times I rewatch it though, I start to understand Thanos point of view more and more. The blurred lines with his motivations make the movie more compelling. Even driving some people to say that Thanos was right in all this. I wouldnt go that far, but I would say his character is misunderstood. Definitely a compelling villain in Thanos.

Guardians of the Galaxy already established just how powerful infinity stones are, but Infinity War seems to forget that. In the battle on Titan, Iron Man and about five others are able to hold Thanos down and nearly get his gauntlet off. At this point, Thanos has four infinity stones. Sorry, but there is no way they could restrain him at that point.  Infinity War also includes four other villains which the directors apparently felt had no need for an introduction.

The chemistry between Dwayne and George is very good, although I feel it couldve had a more emotional element to it. In regards to the humor, some of it landed and some didnt. Overall, If you go into this film and turn your brain off and just enjoy what it is, I think youll have a lot of fun with it.

The monsters are obvious cgi hiding behind dense action sequences, the evil corporate guys are stereotypes from other monster, sci-fi movies we have seen a thousand times before and the military OF COURSE are worthless fodder. Tiny humvees closing in on very fast gigantic animals firing their machineguns knowing previously how that worked out, Apache helicopters firing at close range at a giant wolfs face with his worthless cannon instead of using guided rockets from a distance, and soldiers go out of their way to be squished like bugs ala Kong Skull Island style.

Inspired by a video game Im not familiar with, Rampage is as corny as they come, yet with monsters as gargantuan to the species as Dwayne Johnson is to his, this film somehow works. A science experiment, in the eyes of many, has gone wrong, but in the greedy money grabbing eyes of the people who are in control of the scientists, everything is right on track to make their fortune. Throw the military into the mix and you have a typical Hollywood all action disaster film. Once again Chicago bears the brunt, and its such visual feast of varying shaped buildings, interspersed with bridges, waterways, a raised railway transit system and a huge lake next to it, it must be a movie makers delight to base it as the battlefield of all manner of horror/disaster/saving",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Maybe those weird smiles that every character makes at one point are scary to others, but I found them funny every time.  The movie is pretty straightforward, but Ill give a brief explanation anyway. A group of friends goes to Mexico on spring break. While there, a stranger invites them to play truth or dare in a creepy abandoned church. It turns out that the game is possessed by a demon who follows them and forces them to continue playing the game until every player is dead. Fail a dare, you die. Tell a lie, you die. Refuse to play, you die.  The game and movie are essentially Jumanji crossed with Final Destination. Its PG-13, so its not nearly as graphic as Final Destination, which I didnt mind.

It was very well made, and many of the good things they did in the first film is in this one too. I loved the chemistry between all the characters... the same great chemistry from the first. The actors all did great jobs with the voicing of the characters. Helen Parr/Elastagirl really shines here, she is the main focal point throughout the majority of the film, and I was glad she was because its so entertaining to see Helen kick butt, and it was fun to see Bob/mr incredible have to stay home and try his best alone with the kids. Being alone with them proves very hard, especially when Jack Jack starts experimenting with his powers... Which leads to some very funny moments. The villain was voiced well Catherine Keener, this is a spoiler but honestly I could who the villain was early on...

I have a number of issues with it, but lets get into the first one.Tone Not every film in a series/sequence needs to maintain consistent tone, I get that. But the first film has always stood out from other animated movies, because of its serious tone and mature themes children and adults can enjoy it. This movie feels like a different franchise entirely. It lacks all the high stakes, emotion, and seriousness of the first film.

652,5,admin-16582,2,Forced feminism ruined this movie.,"This movie is not about family like the first one!Having a strong female lead is great, but emphasizing their superiority over men, over and over, joke after joke, just made this movie unbearable. That is not equality!The first Incredibles movie brought the entire family together as a whole and was solid, one of my all time favorites. Even though the Incredibles 2 started off good and it was funny at first with how Mr Incredible had a hard time with the kids, it never ended. As the movie goes on and on you soon realize whats happening because its not subtle. The boys cant play because their masculinity is too destructive, so Elastigirl has to go solo to restore their image, but shes really just being tricked by an even smarter female who has an idiot for a brother he just happens to be the President of a huge telcom company.

The family for which the movie gets its name is hardly relevant, with Dash and Violet having no impact on the plot and Dash failing to receive even an attempt at a subplot. Mr. Incredible fails in everything he attempts in both heroic and domestic pursuits, and Elastigirl saves a few lives before falling for an obvious trap and being controlled by the villain.As the story comes to its climax, all of the heroes including Frozone and both parents have been enslaved by the villain and its up to Violet, Dash, and Jack-Jack to save the day. Rather than showing how young people can be just as heroic as adults, a car gets to be the hero, with their sole contribution being accidental.

My problem had NOTHING at all to do with the movie having a female lead, but just that it was simply so uninteresting! Too much dialogue and build-up that never went anywhere, the characters were whiny, and I dont even think kids over 4 would enjoy this snooze-fest if even then. What a waste of the past 14 years  all that time passed and no one bothered to develop a clever or entertaining plot/script. My kiddo and I booked it immediately as the credits began to roll.

What made the movie bad was the intense focus on the family life and mr incredibles internal struggles with his wife working while he stayed at home.

663,5,corpse_man,2,Another movie ruined by radical feminism.,"First of all, this movie is nothing but a giant piece of propaganda. I was a huge fan of the original Incredibles, and its quite sad to see this new film reduced to nothing more than a means to push radical neo feminist ideologies.To summarize the plot, its basically about how Elastigirl is a more competent superhero than Mr Incredible, and so she gets chosen to be the face of the new superhero resurgence, while Mr incredible stays at home and looks after the kids. Not surprisingly, the movie emphasizes how poorly Mr incredible is at handling his new duties at home. The main message of this movie is that Elastigirl is just as good or better than Mr Incredible at superhero work, while Mr Incredible is vastly inferior at taking care of the kids and home life in general. So basically, he is just all around inferior to her. Or lets just say it out loud, Men are inferior to women. That is the real message of the film. Ironically, it was actually released right before FATHERS DAY!!!Now if so",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

667,6,johngiovannicorda,8,The Lady Is A Star,"This is the 4th version of A Star Is Born Ive seen - 5th if you count What Price Hollywood - each version had a life of their own and reflected the times of the time in which it was made. The 2018 version is no exception. For me represented also the revelation of Lady Gaga as a phenomenal film presence. She is, quite simply, superb. Moving, powerful and real. Janet Gaynor had brought a form of overwhelming innocence, Judy Garland exploded in heartbreak in a Hollywood that doesnt exist anymore and she was, unquestionably, memorable. Barbara Streisand was tough with a strong sense of self even during her tribulations. Lady Gaga brings a little of each of them as well as something profoundly personal. Kudos to Bradley Cooper. His Norman Maine has a new name and a totally new presence. At times this version seems more about him than about her. In any case, I loved them both - Bravo!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
668,6,superdupersentinel,6,Is it a good film? Yes. Oscar material? No.,"Let me start by saying that the performances are solid. Not mind blowing but solid. For her first film, Lady Gaga did very well but I cant say she blew my mind...but hey its her first film and I like her, so good for her. That being said, the film seems to be getting WAY overblown by people. The first act is really great and the chemistry between Gaga and Cooper is phenomenal but after that it sort of devolves into a melodrama. The character development of Coopers character is lacking. He is an alcoholic and we certainly see him drunk many times but I didnt see enough struggle to justify his character arc not was Coopers performance powerful enough to convey the devastating agony of addiction. The film then goes through a few cliches as we see Gagas character ascend to fame but again, we also dont see enough struggle from her character either. In all, the character conflicts are addressed but the film never fully dives into them in the way it certainly could have. I loved the first son",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We live in an era where even Ghostbusters is no longer sacred. Where you wouldnt be surprised if one of the large studios announced a remake of the Godfather or Citizen Kane. Those remakes might capture some audience members, but those films almost certainly dont capture the audiences hearts. They certainly dont capture the praise critics. They certainly dont take home any major awards.That all changes with A Star is Born.Change, however, is a key word when it comes to remakes. Or remakes of remakes of remakes... In order to make the venture worthwhile, the film makers not only have to stay close to the ideas of original film, but they have to have a reason to retell the story. Its a delicate balance.

Maybe women love Bradley Cooper so this is his vanity project in which he is credited as the writer, director, and star. Heck, Bradley Cooper even went as far as having a Sam Elliott voice over by copying Elliotts gravelly voice and Mr. Vanity Cooper even gives himself several minutes of solo face time singing as a past-his-prime-time weary weathered alcoholic singing star.Oh sure, Cooper pulled out as many pity points that he possibly could by including his loyal dog pining for our over the hill rock star.

Clearly Gaga devotees will see no fault. The pacing of the movie was laborious at times with any tension evaporating entirely.

Despite its long running time, theres so much packed into the opening act, and its delivered with jaw-dropping passion and energy, to the point where I felt absolutely exhilarated by the film within such a short period of time.The passion with which Bradley Cooper is directing the movie is clear from the opening scene, and as we see our superstar musician form an unlikely and unexpected bond with a young local singer, the film begins to tell that age-ol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
