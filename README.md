# Recommender Systems
  
Assignments and projects are designed to build and evaluate different kinds of recommender systems, using both R or Python. Some of the course work will be done using Apache Spark.

## Projects

#### Project 1 - Global Baseline Predictors and RMSE:  
Task: Predict ratings with very little information using just raw averages across all (training dataset) users.  Account for "bias" by normalizing across users and across items. Assignment requires working with ratings in a user-item matrix, where each rating may be (1) assigned to a training dataset, (2) assigned to a test dataset, or (3) missing.

#### Project 2 - Content-Based and Collaborative Filtering:
Task: Start with an existing dataset of user-item ratings, such as the toy books dataset, MovieLens, Jester or another dataset of your choosing. Implement at least two of these recommendation algorithms:
+  Content-Based Filtering 
+  User-User Collaborative Filtering 
+  Item-Item Collaborative Filtering 

#### Project 3 - Matrix Factorization Methods:
Task: Working with Matrix Factorization techniques, implement a matrix factorization method—such as singular value decomposition (SVD) or Alternating Least Squares (ALS)—in the context of a recommender system.

#### Project 4 - Accuracy and Beyond:
Task: Compare the accuracy of at least two recommender system algorithms against your offline data. Implement support for at least one business or user experience goal such as increased serendipity, novelty, or diversity. Compare and report on any change in accuracy before and after changes. 

#### Final Project:
Task: Produce quality recommendations by extracting insights from a large data-set using Apache Spark.
